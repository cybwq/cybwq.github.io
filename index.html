    <h1>Modern Love.</h1>
    <h2 style="font-style: italic"> "I mean, does anyone have life ‘figured out’?"</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic">- Frances Ha in movie "Frances Ha"</p>
    <hr>
        <p>Frances:"It's that thing when you're with someone, and you love them and they know it, and they love you and you know it... </p>
            <p>but it's a party... and you're both talking to other people, and you're laughing and shining... 
                <p>and you look across the room and catch each other's eyes...but - but not because you're possessive, or it's precisely sexual... </p>
                  <p>but because... that is your person in this life. And it's funny and sad, but only because this life will end,</p>
                   <p>and it's this secret world that exists right there in public, unnoticed, that no one else knows about. </p>
                      <p>It's sort of like how they say that other dimensions exist all around us, but we don't have the ability to perceive them. </p>
                        <p>That's - That's what I want out of a relationship. Or just life, I guess."</p>

        <p style="color: darkslategray; font-style: initial;">Remembere the scene when Frances was running and dancing across streets with an uninhibitedly sunny smile?</p>
        <p style="color: darkslategray">Can you feel her pain and joy altogether at once? </p>
